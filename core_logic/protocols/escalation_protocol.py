"""
This module contains the logic for the question escalation protocol, which
is triggered when an agent determines it lacks the information to proceed.

def handle_question_escalation(orchestrator, start_agent_id: str, question: str) -> str:
    """
    Manages the escalation of a question up the chain of command.

    The process continues until an agent in the hierarchy can provide an
    answer or until it reaches the top-level agent (who then escalates to
    the user).

    Args:
        orchestrator: The main orchestrator instance.
        start_agent_id: The ID of the agent who originally asked the question.
        question: The question text from the agent.

    Returns:
        A string containing the final answer or a notification that the
        question was escalated to the user.

    # --- FUTURE LOGIC WILL GO HERE ---
    # 1. Start a loop that begins with the parent of start_agent_id.
    #    current_agent_id = orchestrator.get_parent(start_agent_id)
    #
    # 2. Inside the loop, check the Orchestrator's turn_counter to prevent
    #    infinite loops, halting if the MAX_INTERNAL_TURNS limit is reached.
    #
    # 3. Format the question as a new task for the parent agent.
    #    e.g., "My subordinate ({start_agent_id}) has a question: {question}"
    #
    # 4. Call the parent agent's execute_task method.
    #
    # 5. Analyze the response:
    #    a. If it's a definitive answer (not another question), the loop breaks.
    #       - The answer is added to the KnowledgeBase.
    #       - The final answer is returned to be cascaded down.
    #    b. If it's another [QUESTION], update the question text and continue
    #       the loop to the next parent.
    #
    # 6. If the loop completes (reaches the CEO who still has a question),
    #    return a final message escalating the question to the human user.

    return "Escalation protocol initiated. Awaiting implementation of upward query loop."
