# Dynamic Task Graph - Technical Specification

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the technical specification for the new Dynamic Task Graph feature.  This feature will allow for the dynamic creation, modification, and execution of task graphs, enhancing workflow flexibility and efficiency.

**2. Architecture**
The system will employ a microservices architecture, with individual services responsible for task creation, scheduling, execution monitoring, and data management.  A message queue (e.g., Kafka) will facilitate asynchronous communication between services.  The graph database will be [specify database, e.g., Neo4j] to efficiently manage relationships between tasks.

**3. Data Model**
* **Task:**  [Describe fields, e.g., ID, name, status, dependencies, executor]
* **Dependency:** [Describe fields, e.g., source_task_id, target_task_id, type]
* **Execution Log:** [Describe fields, e.g., task_id, start_time, end_time, status, logs]

**4. API Design**
RESTful API endpoints will be defined for:
* Creating new tasks
* Updating task details
* Retrieving task status
* Defining task dependencies
* Triggering graph execution
* Monitoring graph execution

**5. Scalability**
The system will be designed for horizontal scalability, allowing for the addition of more nodes to handle increased workload.  Load balancing will be implemented using [specify load balancing technique].

**6. Security**
All API calls will be secured using [specify authentication/authorization method].  Data will be encrypted at rest and in transit.

**7. Future Considerations**
* Integration with existing monitoring and logging systems.
* Support for different execution environments (e.g., cloud, on-premise).
* Advanced features, such as automatic task scheduling and failure recovery.
