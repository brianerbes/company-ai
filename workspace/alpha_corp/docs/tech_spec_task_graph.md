# Dynamic Task Graph Technical Specification

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the technical specification for the new Dynamic Task Graph feature. This feature allows for dynamic creation and modification of task graphs, enabling efficient execution of complex workflows.

**2. Architecture**
[Insert detailed architectural diagram here.  This will be a textual description for now, later replaced with a proper diagram.] The system uses a microservices architecture with a central Graph Manager, worker services for task execution, a message queue (Kafka) for inter-service communication, and a relational database (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage. The Graph Manager handles graph creation, modification, and monitoring. Worker services execute individual tasks.  The message queue ensures loose coupling and scalability. The database stores task metadata and execution history. Communication flow: Graph Manager -> Kafka -> Worker Services -> Kafka -> Graph Manager. Data persistence: PostgreSQL.

**3. Data Model**

{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "Task": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": {"type": "string", "format": "uuid"},
        "name": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 255},
        "type": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 50},
        "status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["CREATED", "RUNNING", "COMPLETED", "FAILED"]},
        "dependencies": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "format": "uuid"}},
        "input_data": {"type": "object"}, 
        "output_data": {"type": "object"}
      },
      "required": ["id", "name", "type", "status"]
    },
    "Graph": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": {"type": "string", "format": "uuid"},
        "name": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 255},
        "tasks": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "format": "uuid"}}
      },
      "required": ["id", "name", "tasks"]
    }
  }
}

[Relationships: One-to-many between Graph and Task.  Dependencies in Task form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Constraints: Task IDs must be unique within a graph.  Graph names must be unique.]

**4. API Design**
[Detailed API specifications with request/response examples and error handling using JSON Schema will be added here.  This will include authentication (OAuth 2.0) and authorization (RBAC) details.  Rate limiting strategies will also be defined.]

**5. Scalability**
[Detailed scalability analysis including load balancing strategies, database sharding techniques, queue management, capacity planning, and performance benchmarks will be added here.]

**6. Security**
[Detailed security assessment including authentication (OAuth 2.0 with specific token management), authorization (RBAC with specific roles and permissions), data encryption (algorithms and key management), vulnerability mitigation strategies, and incident response plans will be added here.  This section will also include details on security auditing and penetration testing.]

**7. Future Considerations**
[Future enhancements, including integration with monitoring systems, advanced scheduling, and support for new task types will be added here.]
