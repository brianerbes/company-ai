"""
This module contains the logic for handling downward delegation of tasks,
especially when a single task is assigned to multiple subordinates,
triggering a "group chat" or "team meeting" scenario.

    Manages the delegation of a task from a manager to multiple subordinates.

    This function will create a temporary, shared conversation history for the
    duration of the briefing to ensure all team members are aligned.

    Args:
        orchestrator: The main orchestrator instance.
        sender_id: The ID of the manager agent delegating the task.
        recipient_ids: A list of subordinate agent IDs receiving the task.

    # 1. Create a temporary conversation ID for this group meeting.
    #    e.g., group_chat_id = f"group_task_{orchestrator.turn_counter}"
    #
    # 2. Add the initial task_message from the sender to this temporary history.
    #
    # 3. Loop through the recipients and let them "read" the message.
    #    For each recipient, call their execute_task method.
    #
    # 4. If any recipient responds with a [QUESTION], add both the question
    #    and the manager's subsequent answer to the *shared* temporary history.
    #
    # 5. Continue this Q&A loop until no more questions are asked.
    #
    # 6. Once the briefing is complete, merge the temporary group history into
    #    the permanent history of each participating agent.
    #
    # 7. Return a status message like "Task successfully delegated to all parties."
    #
    
    return "Delegation protocol initiated. Group alignment pending implementation."
